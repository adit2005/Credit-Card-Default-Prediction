## About The Project

The Credit Card Default Prediction project is an end-to-end machine learning initiative designed to predict whether credit card holders will default on their payments in the next month. Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the  biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.
